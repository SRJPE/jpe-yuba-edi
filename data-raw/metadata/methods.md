## Trap equipment

Two 8-foot rotary screw traps; one 5-foot RST (depending on conditions)
Quantity = 3 (max)  

## Current and historical trap locations

Hallwood Boulevard RST site at RM 7.5

## Monitoring schedule

November-June
Continuously trapping except under high flows, high temperatures, and unsafe working conditions
Serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch

## Daily environmental data

Daily environmental data collected are water temperature (Celsius), turbidity (Nephelometric Turbidity Units), and weather.

## Fish measurements

Fork length measurements to nearest mm taken for Chinook (50 randomly selected of each run type, run determined by Greene 1992 Length-at-Date chart), Steelhead (first 50), and non-salmonids (up to 20).

## Fish counts

All fish not measured are plus counted by hand. If juvenile salmon are highly abundant (5,000+), a simple volume displacement method is used to speed up processing. Efforts are made to ensure welfare of fish is maintained during capture and handling; however, fish may be affected by other pathogens and disease which may increase the possibility of mortality. Run assignments in the historical data may be inconsistent with contemporary methods for assigning run.

## Trap efficiency trials

Natural origin Chinook captured in RSTs are the primary source of released fish. When the catch of wild emigrants is too low for viable efficiency releases, Feather River Hatchery fish can be used as surrogates. Once weekly (December-April) across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals and/or availability of hatchery surrogates allow. A minimum of 3 consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analysis. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site approximately 0.5 miles upstream of the trap site. Fish may be released by boat during high flow conditions.

## Trap efficiency mark rotation

Fish are marked with a colored Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE), and/or a Bismarck brown Y (BBY) whole body stain. Elastomer colors and/or marking locations on the fish are used to create unique marks. A unique mark is not used again for 7 days to ensure release groups of the same mark do not overlap.
